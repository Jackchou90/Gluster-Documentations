### Wrap Up

So, that’s it, you set up your first Gluster storage cluster! Once you
have done it a few times, you will be amazed at how fast it really can
be. In most cases, if your servers are ready, the entire installation
from starting to download the packages to having the client mount point
copying in data is less than 5 minutes. The most common question tends
to be “Well, what else do we have to do from here to set up Gluster?”.
Feel free to be smug when you say “Nothing.” Please see the additional
resources below to help you get the most out of your Gluster experience.
