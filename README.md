# Gluster-Docs
Compilation of Documentation from various sources

## Purpose
This repository holds all the Documemtation available at various sources*.What follows is a process of removing redundant content. A larger perspectiev is to create a single point documentation guide with classification or segregation into different category of users (like Administrators, Developers and users).

A single point Documentation holds a high importance as it consolidates every information available in one place with constant terminologies. It also reduces ambiguity.


*Curating from various sources refers to data curated from gluster.org/documentation, gluster.org/community/documentation, blogs written by developers, community contributers etc. 

The FAQs and other troubleshooting guide will refer existing documentation as well as the mailing lists, discussion forums etc.

In this process of getting together documentations from various sources, filling up of gaps wherever necessary can be done.
