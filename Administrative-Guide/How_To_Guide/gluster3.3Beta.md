Two of the biggest features of this release are:

    2nd beta release of the upcoming GlusterFS 3.3, we added the ability
    to use GlusterFS as the backend data store for Apache Hadoop.

    allows admins to utilize the same data store for both POSIX-style
    mounts as well as S3 or Swift-compatible APIs.
